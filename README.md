＃ Solidity 언어의 장단점 
</br> － Strengths of Solidity

“It’s designed specifically for smart contracts, so it’s tightly integrated with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.”

“It provides strong tooling support, like Hardhat and Foundry, which makes development and testing much easier.”

“Its syntax is familiar to JavaScript developers, so it’s relatively easy to start with.”

“It supports features like events, modifiers, and inheritance, which help organize contract logic cleanly.”


－ Weaknesses of Solidity

“Because it interacts with blockchain directly, small mistakes can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.”

“Gas optimization can be tricky, and developers must constantly think about cost efficiency.”

“The language evolves quickly, so keeping up with version changes is essential.”

“Debugging is harder compared to typical programming languages due to the blockchain environment.”
